# javaScript-game-Catch-The-Fairy
This is my second java script project. After creathing the monkey in motion game, 
using the simple click events and emoji, 
here I tried doing something using real images instead of emojies. 
In this game I used a lil bit of jQuery also. There are three closed doors in the game, 
at once you can only open one door, there are three possible elements behind each door. 
a robo, a fairy or a dianosaur. Your goal is to catch the fairy and avoid the robo. 
You can see your total score also.
I learnt a few new things while creating this project.
I also added sound offect while you click on the close door to open it.
